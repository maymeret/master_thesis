# master_thesis
Here are the important scripts I wrote for my Master's thesis. The primary purpose is to have transparency regarding my post-processing. If you notice anything that could be improved, please write to me; I'm always happy to receive tips. The beginning of a lot of the scripts is repetitive because they all read in the same data, etc., so if I were you, I'd skip the first third of each script :)
